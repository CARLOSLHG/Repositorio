**CyberSpace Defenders** is an educational game developed in JavaScript to teach cybersecurity concepts in an entertaining way to children between the ages of 8 and 16. In this game, players take on the role of **Guardians of Cyberspace** and control a **Virtual Defense Shield**, an advanced AI created to protect the digital universe. The mission is to defend cyberspace from digital threats by eliminating various cyber threats while dodging "junk data packets" floating in the system.

## Objective of the Game

The mission of the Guardians of Cyberspace is simple yet crucial: intercept and neutralize each digital threat represented by asteroids containing cybersecurity dangers, such as:

- **Viruses**
- **DDoS Attacks**
- **Phishing**
- **Malware**
- **Ransomware**
- **Spyware**

In addition, they must dodge **Junk Data Packets** (fragments of useless data or code debris). These junk data packets do not pose a direct threat but can distract or divert players from their main mission. Avoiding them is key to advancing safely.

Each neutralized threat contributes to digital space security, helping players to understand in a fun way how protection works in the world of cybersecurity.

The game tracks progress in:
- **Cybersteps**: representing the safe zones navigated.
- **Number of Neutralized Threats**: the number of eliminated cyber threats.
- **Dodged Junk Data Packets**: counts the fragments of useless data that the player manages to dodge.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML and CSS**: For structure and design.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactions.

## Game Instructions

- Use the mouse to move the Virtual Defense Shield.
- Press the left mouse button to shoot and eliminate threats before they reach your AI defense.
- Dodge the junk data packets floating in cyberspace; they can distract you, but there is no need to eliminate them.
- Each neutralized threat and each dodged junk data packet increases your score and helps keep cyberspace secure.

## Project Features

- Designed to be intuitive and accessible for children.
- Combines fun with learning about cybersecurity.
- Exposes players to key online security terms while they play.

## Narrative for Players

> "Welcome, Guardians of Cyberspace! You control a powerful Defense AI tasked with protecting cyberspace from threats. As you navigate safe zones, you will encounter digital threats trying to infiltrate our system, which must be intercepted and neutralized. There will also be junk data packets (fragments of useless data) floating in digital space, which do not need to be eliminated but should be dodged to stay focused on the real threats. The fate of our digital world is in your hands!"
