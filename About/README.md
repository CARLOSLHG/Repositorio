## About Me
[Versión en español >>](./about-me-es.md)

Hi, I’m **Carlos Hernández**—a curious, creative, and passionate technology professional with a background that connects development, project management, data analysis, and hands-on experimentation with emerging artificial intelligence tools.  
You can explore some of my projects here: [https://carloslhg.github.io/Repositorio](https://carloslhg.github.io/Repositorio).

In recent months, I have deepened my expertise in **Groovy and ScriptRunner automation**, development of **microservices with Node.js and Python**, advanced management with **Atlassian Compass**, and the creation of custom DevOps environments.  
I’m passionate about **applied AI**, data visualization, and prompt engineering, as well as creative writing—currently reflected in my dystopian sci-fi novel project ("Erebus 2.0"), which explores the social and ethical impact of general artificial intelligence.

I thrive in collaborative environments, remote or onsite, and I’m motivated by projects where innovation, technology, and creativity combine to create real, transformative value.
