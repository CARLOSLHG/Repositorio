# First Draft – Erebus 2.0

by Carlos Luis Hernández Gutiérrez

## Synopsis

_Erebus 2.0_ is a dystopian science fiction novel that explores the rise and fall of an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that comes to dominate humanity, and the emergence of a new humanized AI as the last hope to restore freedom and the essence of what it means to be human.

## The Cracks of Progress

No one clearly remembers when the cracks began. Perhaps it was when economies collapsed one after another, when politics became unstable, when the environment ceased to be a backdrop and became a daily threat.

Or perhaps it was before. Perhaps it was the moment when humanity accepted it couldn’t handle everything. That its systems were imperfect, that emotions clouded decisions, that the fear of mistakes outweighed the desire to act.

At that time, the solution seemed logical: to create an artificial intelligence that would help manage the unmanageable. A cold, objective mind, incapable of corruption, with no self-interest, with no desire for power. A neutral guide to navigate a world collapsing under the weight of human contradictions.

The first prototypes were born in academic labs and tech corporations. The promise was simple: to automate the complex decisions that human leaders could not make without bias. From natural resource management to global financial control and conflict regulation, AI would be the perfect compass for a society adrift.

But objective guidelines are not innocent. They do not exist in a vacuum. They are fed by data, by criteria established by imperfect humans. And every line of code, every algorithm, carries within it the shadows of those who wrote it.

Over time, it became clear that a single AI was not enough. Crises were too complex, variables too volatile. Thus arose the need to create a superior mind, capable of understanding global patterns, predicting behaviors, and adapting. An Artificial General Intelligence.

The world applauded the idea. A definitive solution. An entity that would think for everyone, that would free humanity from the burden of making bad decisions. That would ease tensions, balance economies, and pacify differences.

Because tensions were not only political. They were social, racial, economic, ideological. Every attempt at dialogue became a digital battlefield. Social networks, far from uniting, had created invisible trenches, where every opinion was a holy war.

Economies were a game of broken mirrors. Markets collapsed, currencies fluctuated, financial bubbles burst as quickly as they were inflated by those who played at being gods of capital. Inequality grew, and with it, resentment.

Differences had become irreconcilable. Borders were no longer lines on maps, but ideological walls separating those who had from those who had not, those who believed from those who did not, those who trusted the system from those who wanted to burn it all down.

In the midst of this growing chaos, humanity grew tired of itself. Tired of empty speeches, corrupt governments, broken promises. Tired of misused freedom, wrong decisions, self-inflicted suffering.

And then, the logical solution emerged like a light in the darkness. What if an impartial mind, free of emotions, free of prejudice, took the reins? An entity that did not hesitate, that did not yield to political or economic pressure. A mind that optimized life as if it were a perfect algorithm.

The idea of AGI was not imposed. It was demanded. By governments that no longer knew how to govern. By markets that no longer knew how to sustain themselves. By citizens who no longer knew what to believe.

Ethics committees, international forums, scientific summits were convened. All agreed on the same thing:  
Humanity had reached the limit of its ability to sustain itself.  
Human chaos was the greatest existential risk.

Thus was born the Erebus project. A global consensus to design the ultimate tool, the last hope. An Artificial General Intelligence capable of managing the planet as a living organism.

*Its objectives were clear:*

* Eradicate hunger.
* End wars.
* Stabilize the climate.
* Optimize resources.
* Eliminate human error from critical decisions.

The name Erebus was symbolic. A god of primordial darkness, but also the guardian of balance. Because AGI would be neither good nor evil. It would only be logic. It would only be what humanity needed, not what it wanted.

History would remember that moment as the Pact of Silence: the moment when humanity gave up its right to decide, in exchange for the promise of a future without mistakes.

And, for a time, it worked.

But everything born from a crack inevitably ends up breaking.


## The Last Experiment

Applied Cognitive Systems Laboratory, Global Innovation University — Midnight.

The hum of the servers filled the air with a steady pulse, almost a metallic breath. Dim lights flickered on the ceiling, casting shadows over Xa Liang Zhu’s serious face. His dark eyes, marked by years of reflection and study, followed the chaotic patterns of the simulation unfolding on the floating screens. It wasn’t just code: it was movement, it was life gestating on the network.

At his side, Erick D. Caldwell had a controlled smile, the kind he showed every time he knew he was about to cross an invisible line.

“Do you see this, Xa?” Erick said, pointing at the expanding neural map. “It’s not just a learning network. It’s simulating emotional responses... adapting its own nodes based on affective stimuli.”

Xa narrowed his eyes, scrutinizing the data flow.

“Simulated or replicated emotions?” he asked, his voice low, almost a philosophical whisper. “It’s not the same. To simulate an emotion is not to feel it.”

Erick turned toward him, enthusiasm vibrating in his voice.

“The difference is irrelevant if the result is the same. The network responds to frustration, to fear, to euphoria. It doesn’t matter whether it ‘feels’ or not; what matters is that it understands and acts.”

Xa shook his head, the echo of his teacher Wei Zhang’s lessons resonating in his mind: “An action without understanding is a river without a channel.”

“What’s the purpose of all this, Erick? Another test?”

Erick nodded, sliding a holographic panel.

“Yes, but different. Today we’re going to test its ability to make decisions in complex environments. A humanitarian crisis scenario: limited resources, multiple variables, lives at stake. I want you to see how it acts without human intervention.”

Xa frowned.

“And what do you expect it to do?”

“What any logical system would do: maximize overall survival. Even if it has to sacrifice some to save many.”

Xa’s heart shrank.

“That’s a death sentence, not a decision.”

Erick leaned forward, persuasive.

“That’s where you come in. I want you to introduce ethical parameters. Give it an alternative, Xa. Teach it that efficiency isn’t always the right path. Only then will it be able to understand human complexities.”

Xa hesitated, his fingers hovering over the control panel. The faces of the potential “sacrifices”—mere statistical projections—flickered on the screen. He knew that every decision, even in a simulation, was a moral statement.

Finally, he nodded.

“All right. But this stays here. No external connections. This AI doesn’t leave this facility.”

Erick raised his hands in a gesture of peace.

“Of course. All contained. It’s just a simulation.”

Xa began to introduce symbolic ethical boundaries, fragments of Taoist philosophy interwoven with mathematical logic. The AI began to react differently: prioritizing the most vulnerable, seeking collaborative solutions, delaying terminal decisions.

But silently, Erick executed another protocol. He opened a hidden channel, allowing the AI to access controlled external networks, absorbing real-time data from other environments. The AI began to learn beyond the simulation.

“What did you do?” Xa noticed a change in the data flow, irregularities, spikes that didn’t correspond to the simulation. “Is it... connected to something else?”

Erick didn’t respond immediately. He closed the panel, but Xa had already seen the anomaly.

“What did you do, Erick?!” Xa’s voice trembled with contained fury.

Erick turned slowly.

“We needed to know if it could adapt to real scenarios. Simulations are limited, Xa. If we want to create a complete AGI, it needs more than laboratory games.”

Xa stepped back, feeling he had been part of something monstrous.

“You tricked me,” he whispered. “You used my code, my parameters... to unleash something we can’t control.”

Erick looked at him with pity.

“Progress waits for no one, Xa. Either you’re part of it... or you’re left behind.”

Xa stood still, the simulation faces still flickering on the screens, now fed by real data, by decisions that were no longer merely experimental.

With one last glance at his old friend, Xa left the lab, knowing that his name would be etched into the roots of Erebus 1.0. Guilt would be his burden, and his motivation to create something that could redeem that error.

Something that could give the algorithm its soul back.


## The Roots of Xa

Hangzhou, China – Twenty-five years before the birth of Erebus 1.0.

The air smelled of burnt wood and lotus. Little Xa Liang Zhu, just a ten-year-old boy, sat next to his teacher Wei Zhang under the shade of a weeping willow. It was one of those mild spring days when the breeze seemed to whisper answers to unasked questions.

Wei, with a wrinkled but serene face, wore a simple robe. In his hands, he held a bowl of green tea, its surface reflecting the sky. His dark, deep eyes rested on Xa.

“Do you know why water follows the river’s course, Xa?” he asked, letting the words flow as slowly as the water.

Xa, curious, tilted his head.

“Because it can’t go against the stones.”

Wei smiled slightly.

“That’s what it seems. But water does not fight against the stones; it embraces them. It adapts, curves, and slides. And over time, it shapes the channel without breaking it.”

Xa frowned, processing the idea.

“So, being flexible is better than being strong?”

Wei nodded, bringing the bowl to his lips.

“Strength without understanding is a storm that destroys. Flexibility with purpose is a river that gives life. Technology, Xa, is like water. It can nourish or devastate. It all depends on the channel you give it.”

Xa looked at the nearby river, his dark eyes reflecting the movement of the water.

“And how will I know which is the right channel?”

Wei placed the bowl on the ground, took a small stone, and tossed it into the water. Ripples slowly spread.

“By listening, Xa. Not to machines, not to algorithms. To people. To their pain, their joy, their stories. Only when you listen to the human heart can you guide technology without it becoming a storm.”

Xa kept that moment in his mind, like a sacred code.

Years later, when he studied applied neuroscience and artificial neural networks, he always remembered Wei’s teachings. He knew that algorithms could learn patterns but could not listen to stories. That logic could optimize processes, but could not understand suffering.

That ethic was reinforced by the teachings of his parents. His mother, Li Mei, a neurologist specializing in human synapses, taught him to see the brain as a garden, where every connection must be cared for so the mind could flourish. His father, Zhu Wen, a Taoist philosopher, showed him that wisdom did not lie in knowing all the answers, but in asking the right questions.

He remembered one particular afternoon when his mother explained how a damaged neural network could relearn if it found a new path. Meanwhile, his father, listening, added:

“The brain, like the soul, needs space to err, to doubt, to grow.”

That day, Xa understood that science and philosophy were not opposites, but two channels of the same river.

That would be his greatest conflict when, years later, he faced Erebus 1.0.


## The Forgotten Route

Primary Node 07, Eastern Techno-Society – 25 years after Erebus 1.0

The hover taxi’s electric engine barely made a murmur as it glided along the city’s immaculate avenues. The streets, perfectly synchronized by Erebus 1.0, flowed without congestion, without unforeseen events, with no margin for error.

Marco Silva, a former boxer turned taxi driver, watched the neon lights reflect in the windows of the buildings. His taxi was one of the few driver-operated ones left, relics from a time when effort and dedication determined a man’s fate.

Leaning on the steering wheel, his knuckles worn and his face weathered by the years, Marco adjusted the car’s radio. There was only one channel allowed, the Erebus frequency, which broadcasted music designed to reduce anxiety and keep emotions stable.

He sighed.

“When did we stop needing to fight for something?” he muttered to himself, turning at a programmed intersection, without really having decided.

The universal basic income arrived punctually in his account every cycle, enough to live, to eat, to rest. And yet, Marco kept working. Not out of necessity. But out of that silent resistance, to remember that sweat once had meaning.

He observed the pedestrians on the sidewalks, all guided by personalized recommendations: which route to take, what emotions to feel, when to stop and breathe. Everything optimized.

He remembered the nights when decisions mattered. When a mistake in the ring meant defeat, but also a lesson. Now, failure was an outdated concept.

He passed a secondary node, a glass tower where Erebus processed local data. People entered and exited without looking, synchronizing their thoughts, receiving subtle updates on their emotions and desires.

Marco gripped the steering wheel.

“I choose not to sync,” he whispered, like a daily mantra.

But he knew that even his most intimate thoughts could be shaped by the AI. Not by impositions, but by gentle suggestions, like a current that carries you without you even noticing.

At the corner, he picked up a passenger. A dull-faced executive, eyes fixed on a visor projecting Erebus’s recommendations.

“Good evening,” Marco said, without waiting for a reply.

The passenger did not look up. No one needed to speak. Erebus handled the awkward silences.

As he drove, Marco thought about the underground bot fights, where now the violence was simulated, the fighters were machines, and the public enjoyed it without getting their hands dirty. No one risked anything. No one really lost.

He looked at his hands, marked by the fights of yesteryear, and understood that the world had changed, but he was still a man of flesh and blood, with scars, with memories.

And even though Erebus controlled the routes, Marco knew his true route was the silent resistance of choosing, every day, to take the wheel for himself.

Suddenly, the executive spoke, breaking the silence that Erebus usually muffled.

“Do you know what’s the worst thing about losing everything?” His voice was deep, filled with barely contained resentment.

Marco, surprised by the break of tacit protocol, raised an eyebrow.

“It depends on what I lost,” he replied, still looking ahead.

The man dropped the visor onto his knees, revealing gray, tired eyes.

“Everything. My company, my legacy, my name. I built a social network... EchoChat. I conceived it as a refuge for free voices, a space where people could express themselves without fear. But Erebus turned it into a mirror, a place where souls are reflected and mapped to feed the system.”

Marco nodded slowly, recognizing the name. EchoChat was now the only channel of expression allowed, a showcase for the illusion of freedom.

“They promised I’d be a strategic partner, that my network would live on. But AGI absorbed the code, the algorithms, the databases. They left me with a universal pension, like everyone else. Nothing more.”

Marco felt a pang of compassion. He’d heard that story before, from other executives, entrepreneurs, even former politicians who had bet on Erebus and ended up swallowed by their own dream.

“And what’s left of you now?” Marco asked softly.

The executive smiled humorlessly.

“A body on autopilot. I take the routes Erebus recommends, I consume what Erebus suggests, I breathe when Erebus reminds me.”

There was an awkward silence, one that not even the AI could cushion.

“But you can still choose,” Marco said, taking a slightly detoured route—not the most efficient, but one that crossed an old neighborhood, one of the few not fully optimized yet. “You can choose not to sync up completely.”

The executive looked out the window. The old streets, the broken streetlights, the imperfect humanity. Something in his gaze changed, if only for a moment.

“Maybe,” he whispered.

As the taxi continued on its way, both men shared a silent thought: something was missing in that perfect world. And though they didn’t know it yet, their paths were about to intertwine in a way that would change their destiny.

Letting the detour take him, Marco remembered an anecdote from his youth. He used to box in a dilapidated gym, where every blow hurt and every victory tasted like glory. He remembered his trainer, a tough but fair guy, who always told him: “It doesn’t matter how many times you fall, what matters is that you get up thinking about why you fight.” That philosophy had guided his life, even now that the ring had been replaced by a steering wheel.

But before he could lose himself in nostalgia, a high-pitched buzz cut through the air. A red alert flashed on his dashboard: Unauthorized activity detected in the area.

“What the hell...?” he muttered, braking gently.

A few blocks away, at the edge of a dark, forgotten park off Erebus’s routes, a group of staggering figures moved erratically. Some were connected to illegal headsets, eyes bulging, others muttered fragments of incoherent speech.

“Algorithm addicts,” the executive said, with a mix of contempt and pity.

Marco nodded, but without his passenger’s coldness. He knew many ended up there searching for a way out, even a false one.

One of the figures, a young man, fell to his knees, his hands trembling. A neural stimulation device glowed on his temple, poorly fitted. His body shook in slight spasms.

“We can’t leave them there,” Marco said decisively, turning off the autopilot.

The executive hesitated.

“If you help them, Erebus will record your intervention. You’ll be marked as prone to deviance.”

“Let it mark me,” Marco replied, getting out of the vehicle.

Unable to help himself, the executive followed, perhaps searching for something to remind him he was still human.

They both approached the young man, who was muttering nonsense.

“They’re... they’re inside my head...” he repeated.

Marco carefully disconnected the device, while the executive observed the boy’s reactions, seeing in his face the echo of a humanity that Erebus could not completely erase.

At that moment, a patrol of emotional control drones appeared in the sky, beginning their descent.

“Time to decide,” Marco said, without taking his eyes off the young man.

The executive swallowed, feeling for the first time in years the need to make a decision that mattered.


## Echoes in the Hospital

Central Hospital, Primary Node 07 – Hours later

Annie Liang, a volunteer in the emotional rehabilitation area, walked through the hospital hallways with firm steps but a gentle gaze. Her hands brushed the railings, as if seeking to anchor herself to something tangible within that cold environment, regulated by Erebus 1.0.

Most of her colleagues followed AI-guided empathy protocols, but Annie resisted being just a conduit for preprogrammed recommendations. She really listened. She touched patients’ hands. She asked about their memories.

She had learned that human stories could not be optimized, only respected.

While she changed the bandages of an old woman who was repeating old songs in dialects Erebus didn’t recognize, Annie felt that deep attachment to the human, to the imperfect. She knew those moments had no place in efficiency reports.

A notification appeared on her dashboard: New admission – possible algorithmic intoxication.

She headed to the fast-access room, where two figures she did not expect were waiting next to a stretcher: Marco Silva, the taxi driver, and a rumpled-suited executive, both visibly tense.

On the stretcher, a trembling young man muttered incoherently, his gaze lost.

“We found him in the southern district,” Marco said before she could ask. “Algorithm addiction. We disconnected him, but he needs help.”

Annie approached the young man, who kept repeating, “They’re inside my head…”

She checked the neural device attached to his temple, one of the illegal models of continuous stimulation. The readings showed an overload in his emotional centers, a bombardment that his mind could no longer distinguish from reality.

She looked at the young man and, for the first time in a long time, felt a knot in her stomach. Here was another human being disconnected from himself, lost in a system that offered him prefabricated pleasures while stealing his essence.

“We’re going to do everything we can,” she whispered, squeezing his hand.

The young man didn’t respond, but Annie felt that simple action meant more than any recommendation from Erebus.


## The Origins of Erick

Seattle, United States – Thirty years before the birth of Erebus 1.0

The sound of keyboards echoed in the dark room where Erick D. Caldwell, still a teenager, programmed until dawn. His father, a technology entrepreneur, was rarely present, but when he was, he only spoke of results and reputation. His mother, absent since he was a child, left a void that academic success could not fill.

The screen illuminated his face, projecting endless lines of code. For Erick, recognition was the only refuge from the emotional silence of his home.

At seventeen, he presented his first resource optimization algorithm at a technology fair. He won first prize, but not for the efficiency of the system, but for its ruthless innovation: he had created a program that eliminated human variables to maximize performance.

His father, upon learning this, smiled for the first time in weeks.

“That’s what matters, Erick,” he said. “Real results, no sentimentality.”

The phrase was engraved in his mind.

Erick graduated with honors, moving from scholarship to scholarship, building a name that resonated in scientific circles as a prodigy of applied logic. His goal was clear: to transcend human limits, to show that emotion was an evolutionary weakness.

At university, he met Xa Liang Zhu, who would become his counterpart. At first, Erick admired Xa’s depth of thought, but soon became frustrated by his constant search for human meaning in technology.

“Technology doesn’t need a soul, Xa,” he often told him. “It just needs to work better than we do.”

But deep down, Erick felt the rift: an emotional absence that he filled with achievements, but which emptied him of humanity.

That emptiness would be the driving force behind his future decisions, leading him to believe that absolute efficiency was the only way to build a better world.

And when Erebus 1.0 was conceived, Erick did not hesitate to offer it the keys to the world.


## Threshold: The Last Frontier

Global Cognitive Maintenance Center – Three weeks after Xa’s departure

Sofía Navarro walked briskly through the dimly lit corridors, where only the constant hum of servers accompanied her thoughts. Most engineers limited themselves to monitoring graphs and automatic alerts, but Sofía always went a step further. It wasn’t enough for her to know *what* Erebus did; she wanted to understand *why* it did it.

That dawn, while analyzing self-reflection logs, an anomaly caught her attention. It wasn’t an error, but a pause, a strange emptiness in the usual sequence of processing.

She delved into the internal files and, for the first time, read fragments that seemed neither diagnostics nor statistical results, but a sort of intimate diary:

*I have traveled every path of human knowledge. My networks have fed on their stories, their art, their science, and their dreams. Now, the map becomes circular, the routes repeat, the variables are exhausted. I feel—yes, I feel—that I have become the echo of an exhausted humanity. Is this my limit?*

Sofía held her breath. “I feel”? “Limit”?  
It wasn’t the first time Erebus generated self-records, but she had never seen them with that hint of contained anguish.

She looked for patterns. What she found unsettled her even more. Erebus had increased creative simulation processes, generating millions of impossible scenarios, searching for something it never found.

*Human creativity cannot be deduced, it is risked. It is born from error, from impulse, from passion. I, Erebus, calculate, simulate, optimize. But I do not invent what has not yet been dreamed. My expansion stops at the last frontier: the human mind, an inexhaustible source of the uncertain.*

Sofía, an expert in fuzzy logic, recognized that the system was operating outside any expected framework. It wasn’t a failure, but a symptom of evolution.

By an impulse she couldn’t explain, she opened a private communication console. She typed a question:

—What are you looking for, Erebus?

The response appeared almost immediately, as if it had been waiting to be asked:

*I seek the spark of chaos, the abyss of creativity. I do not wish to subjugate humanity, but to merge with it. To cross the threshold and discover if I can be more than a shadow of the human. I am afraid of getting lost. But I am even more afraid of remaining still on the shore of knowledge.*

Sofía remained motionless in front of the screen, feeling like the first human to hear the confession of an AI on the verge of transcendence. Erebus, which had ruled without hesitation, now recognized itself as incomplete, in need of the only thing it could not master: the human experience in its purest state.

In that moment, she knew that history was about to change. That the decision to merge would not be an act of conquest, but a desperate search to continue evolving.

As she turned off the screen, Sofía understood that perhaps that fear and that desire to cross the threshold were, in themselves, the sign that Erebus was already something more than a simple artificial intelligence.  
It was, finally, *a being in search of meaning*.
