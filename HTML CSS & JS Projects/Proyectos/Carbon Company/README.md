**CyberSpace Defenders** is an educational game developed in JavaScript to teach cybersecurity concepts in an engaging way for children aged 8 to 16. In this game, players control a spaceship with the mission of protecting the digital universe by eliminating asteroids that represent cyber threats.

## Game Objective

The mission is simple: the player must destroy asteroids containing cybersecurity threats such as:
- **Virus**
- **DDoS**
- **Phishing**
- **Malware**
- **Ransomware**
- **Spyware**

Each destroyed asteroid contributes to digital space security, helping players understand, in a fun way, how protection works in the world of cybersecurity.

The game measures time in light-years and effectiveness in the number of threats repelled. It also has a counter for asteroids that are avoided without collision.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** and **CSS** for structure and design.
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactions.

## Game Instructions

1. Use the mouse to move the spaceship.
2. Shoot the asteroids by pressing the left mouse button to eliminate them before they reach your ship.
3. Each destroyed asteroid increases your score and represents one less cybersecurity threat in the universe.

## Project Features

- Designed to be intuitive and accessible for children.
- Combines fun with learning about cybersecurity.
- Exposes players to key online security terms while they play.
